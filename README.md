# Java-For-Industry

In this module we will build on the skills you learnt in Introduction to programming by exploring a new programming language Java. Java is a strongly typed Object Oriented language which allows for the creation of portable programmes. Throughout this module you will learn the key principles of object Orientation; abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation and inheritance. We will be developing applications that explore the potential of programming for developing real world applications and for exploring the theoretical aspects of computer science through code.
